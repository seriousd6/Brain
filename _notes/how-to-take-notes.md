# How to Take Good Notes

Effective note-taking strategies for retaining and retrieving knowledge.

## The Zettelkasten Method

The **Zettelkasten** (German: "slip box") is a note-taking system that emphasizes:

1. **Atomic notes** — one idea per note.
2. **Linking** — connect related notes explicitly.
3. **Own words** — rewrite ideas in your own language.
4. **Review** — revisit and refine notes over time.

## The Cornell Method

Divide your page into three sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Cue column** (left, narrow) | Key questions or keywords |
| **Note area** (right, wide) | Main notes during learning |
| **Summary** (bottom) | Brief summary in your own words |

## Tips

- Write notes immediately after learning something new.
- Use questions as headings to make retrieval easier.
- Prefer brevity; you can always expand later.
- Review notes within 24 hours to reinforce memory.

## Templates
